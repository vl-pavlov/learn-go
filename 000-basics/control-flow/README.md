# Control Flow

The control flow code blocks in Go are much like other popular programming languages

There are three kinds of basic control flow code blocks:
* `if-else` two-way conditional execution block.
* `for` loop block.
* `switch-case` multi-way conditional execution block.
* `for-range` loop block to iterate integers, all kinds of containers, and channels.
