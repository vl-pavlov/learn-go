# Binary tree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has a maximum of two children, called the left child and the right child.

* Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion become easier to understand, to implement.
* Keeping data sorted in a Binary Search Tree (BST) makes searching very efficient.
* Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of child nodes, using an AVL Binary Tree for example.
* Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making the tree more memory efficient.
